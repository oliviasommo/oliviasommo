					    <p> Arguing and Empathy is an e-book designed around three connecting articles written by Don Johnson.
							The three articles are “The Real Reason we get into Arguments,” “Your 
							Opinions are not Facts,” and “How the ‘Verbal Aibido’ can help you avoid Stupid Arguments.” 
							They have a common focus of arguing. He believes the root of all arguments is a lack of empathy.

                        <p> During this project, I learned a lot about typography and how to typeset text while evoking 
							the emotion from the words. I Explored and took many risks with this project by playing with 
							different weights of text and the indentation of each line. There is also a lot of dialogue in 
							these articles, which I wanted to make clear to the reader.

                        <p> To the left is an example of the body text where I utilized indentation 
							and body weight to emphasize key elements of the ‘Verbal Aibido’. The 
							reader can clearly distinguish the processes of the ‘Verbal Aibido’ 
							being addressed and the quote example along with the explanation.  

                        </p> 

						<p> I also used consistent imagery of the exclamation point and comma throughout

                        <p>My design process started with research. After reading the articles 
							and learning about Johnson’s perspective on arguments and empathy, 
							I wanted to find a typeface that applied to both concepts. Montserrat 
							was the best fit for this project because it has 18 different styles 
							and a geometric system. The wide range of styles is also essential 
							for the body text. This typeface gave me the freedom to play 
							with the letterforms and explore the words as if they were arguing.

                        </p>

                    <div class= "Information">

                        <p>During my image research, the two colors that surfaced most frequently 
							were red and blue. Red for arguing and blue for empathy. Red has strong 
							associations with emotion, passion, and anger. Blue is known to be 
							associated with calmness, security, sensitivity, and the truth. 
							Although blue and red are predominately political colors, I did not 
							want this project to have associations with politics. I played with 
							these colors and added a dark purple and light tan color to the pallet 
							to compliment the red and blue. I also took these measures to sway it 
							away from any political relations.

                    <p>Above is one of the many park signs I worked on. 
                        I would make a few of these depending on events or 
                        depending on what the conservancy wanted to emphasize. 
                        I learned a lot about interactive design and how visitors 
                        respond to this type of signage. Specifically, using 
                        typography and the brand identity’s hierarchy to create
                        a sign that is most effective, clearly communicates 
                        the message, and is easy to read. 

                    </p> 

                    <p>The process of creating these signs was very beneficial 
                        to learn because, other than designing the signboard, 
                        I also was responsible for working with the company 
                        VSEEN directly to send all the files to print. 

                    </p> 

                    <p>I would start the design with a blank template file from 
                        Pentagram; then, I would place the text into InDesign 
                        and categorize it with the hierarchy to create the signboard. 
                        Once all the text was in place, I went through all the 
                        typography with a strict eye to make sure all the typography 
                        was correct, and the text was the most optimal for the 
                        audience to read. Once this process was complete, I sent 
                        the file for review, and it would go through a few rounds 
                        of iterations.

                        The DEI brand visually embodies diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
                        Equity as fairness: to allow everyone access to what they need 
                        despite differing circumstances. This is displayed by the different 
                        heights of each rectangle with the help of another rectangle to 
                        allow every column to be equal in height. Diversity through the 
                        changing shapes and colors of each piece of the square, and 
                        inclusion through all the pieces coming together to form one single unit.

                        <p> My process of creating this identity started with researching 
                            other DEI businesses and how to properly incorporate all three 
                            concepts into one icon. Big themes throughout my research were 
                            overlapping shapes, lots of colors, and the concept of puzzle 
                            pieces coming together. After the informational and image 
                            research, I made 100 sketches; below are four of the final
