                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Shoes can tell a lot about a person and who they are. The first thing people tend to notice about a person is their shoes. We use shoes to travel places; they symbolize where we have gone, what we have done in our past, and where we will go in the future. Everyone knows the famous saying, "Before you judge, walk a mile in my shoes." You don't know what people have gone through or where they are going, but your shoes can tell that story.</p>
                        <p>For this project, I created a set of postcards inspired by the theme of travel and observation. Drawing from my time spent people-watching in London, each postcard features a photo I captured, accompanied by a short, imagined backstory. These narratives were designed to prompt the viewer to reflect on where each person might be going and what their story could be.</p>
                        <p>To tie the project together visually, I built a system identity using the London Underground's color palette and typeface, evoking the familiar visual language of the city's transit system and enhancing the sense of place and movement.</p>
                        <p>The most meaningful takeaway from this project was learning to trust the creative process. It also offered a moment to pause and reflect on the lives of others—a quiet exercise in empathy. This project reminded me of the power of small stories and the importance of gratitude, both in design and in life.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>I began this project by researching stories about shoes. Initially, I considered organizing my photographs by shoe type, or arranging them chronologically as a visual journal. However, after receiving feedback, it became clear that the emotional and personal stories behind the shoes resonated more strongly than the imagery or structure. I shifted my focus accordingly, centering the design around these human-centered narratives.</p>
                    <p>The screen printing process was a key part of the project and an exciting learning experience. Although I had screen printed before, this was my first time working at a larger scale. I gained valuable technical skills and a new appreciation for the physicality of the medium.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, screen printing abroad offered a unique perspective—I was able to compare and contrast techniques with those I’d previously used, broadening my understanding of printmaking practices in different cultural contexts.</p>
                    <p>This project was a reminder of the power of everyday objects to carry deeply personal meaning—and how design can give voice to stories we might otherwise overlook.</p>
