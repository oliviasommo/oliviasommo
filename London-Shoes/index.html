                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Shoes can tell a lot about a person and who they are. The first thing people tend to notice about a person is their shoes. We use shoes to travel places; they symbolize where we have gone, what we have done in our past, and where we will go in the future. Everyone knows the famous saying, "Before you judge, walk a mile in my shoes." You don't know what people have gone through or where they are going, but your shoes can tell that story.</p>
                        <p>For this project, I created a set of postcards inspired by the theme of travel and observation. Drawing from my time spent people-watching in London, each postcard features a photo I captured, accompanied by a short, imagined backstory. These narratives were designed to prompt the viewer to reflect on where each person might be going and what their story could be.</p>
                        <p>To tie the project together visually, I built a system identity using the London Underground's color palette and typeface, evoking the familiar visual language of the city's transit system and enhancing the sense of place and movement.</p>
                        <p>The most meaningful takeaway from this project was learning to trust the creative process. It also offered a moment to pause and reflect on the lives of others—a quiet exercise in empathy. This project reminded me of the power of small stories and the importance of gratitude, both in design and in life.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>I began this project with in-depth visual and informational research. A key influence was designer Michael Rock, who emphasizes the importance of critical perspective in design. He argues that every design decision reveals a point of view—a concept that deeply resonated with me and aligned with the central theme of this project. Perspective plays a crucial role in shaping what people perceive as true or false, and this idea became the foundation for all of my conceptual iterations.</p>
                    <p>For the design system, I selected Franklin Gothic Condensed for its bold, eye-catching qualities—evoking the urgency and authority of newspaper headlines. To complement it, I used Times New Roman, a typeface long associated with trustworthiness and credibility.</p>
                    <p>The color palette played a key role in conveying meaning:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blue represents factual, verified information</li>
                        <li>Yellow indicates false or misleading information</li>
                        <li>Green symbolizes opinion presented as fact</li>
                    </ul>
                        These colors help the viewer visually decode the reliability of content, reinforcing the project’s message about media literacy and critical consumption.</p>
                    <p>This project challenged me to expand my skill set and explore new mediums. I experimented with screen printing, CNC routing, Risograph printing, woodworking, and the Adobe Creative Suite to fully bring the concept to life.It was a deeply rewarding experience that pushed both my creative and technical boundaries. I'm proud of the outcome—and even more passionate about using design as a tool for meaningful communication.</p>
