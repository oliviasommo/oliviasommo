					    <p> Shoes can tell a lot about a person and who they are. The first thing 
                            people tend to notice about a person is their shoes. We use shoes to 
                            travel places; they symbolize where we have gone, what we have done 
                            in our past, and where we will go in the future. Everyone knows the 
                            famous saying, "Before you judge, walk a mile in my shoes." You don't 
                            know what people have gone through or where they are going, but your 
                            shoes can tell that story.  
					    </p>

                        <p>I decided to create postcards to align with the theme of travel, I also 
                            used the London tube colors and typeface as the system identity for 
                            this project. Each postcard has a different photo I took while people-watching 
                            during my time in London. I created short background stories for each photo 
                            to get the reader thinking about where the person in the photo was going 
                            and what they were doing.

                            instructions I learned from the London Center for Book Arts.  I enjoyed this experience 
                            because one of my favorite aspects of Graphic Design is crafting and building 
                            to making ideas come to fruition.

                        <p>The biggest takeaway I had from this project was to trust the process, and I

                            is going through. There are so many stories out there, and it was nice to sit 
                            back for a minute to think about empathy for others and gratitude for what I have.

                            I began by researching stories about shoes. I was instantly intrigued by 
                            what was going on behind the shoes everyone wears. I was also interested 
                            in the time and location of the shoes. I was thinking about organizing 
                            my photos by type of shoe or organizing them by time and place as a 
                            type of journaling technique. Below are some of my first and second 
                            iterations of the postcards. After feedback, my peers 
                            gravitated toward the stories more than the imagery or the time and location. 
                            Therefore, I focused on refining that concept for my final design.

                        <p> The screen printing process was a great learning experience for me. 
                            I had a screen printed before this project, but I hadn’t screen printed 
                            this big before, so I learned a new technique. It was nice to compare and 
                            contrast different styles of screen printing. It was also a unique experience 
                            with screen printing in a foreign country.
