					    <p> My job at Vector Media is to create production artwork for a 
                            variety of businesses nationwide, create mockups for buses, 
                            billboards, and bus shelters, and help out with in-house design 
                            projects, including creating the 25-year anniversary logo and 
                            the Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity logo for Vector Media. 
                            Some of the production artwork I did also included a large 
                            range of media. I worked on bus full wraps, bus shelters, 
                            digital billboards, king and queen-size bus ads, etc. I am 
                            grateful for the opportunity to work at Vector Media and for 
                            everything I’ve learned. 
					    </p>

					    <p> Throughout the multiple projects I was given, I took every 
                        experience as a chance to learn and grow as a designer.  I 
                        also worked with various clients and have learned a lot about 
                        the client and designer relationship.
					    </p>

                        <p> I am one of three designers on the marketing team at Vector 
                        Media. Working as a team was also a great learning experience. 
                        Receiving and asking for feedback on every project was very 
                        important to me in building effective designs and a healthy 
                        work environment.

                        <p>To the left is one of the many bus designs I created. 
                            This was a fun wrap, including the inside wrap. This 
                            was my first opportunity to be able to wrap the inside 
                            of the bus along with the outside. It has been amazing 
                            work with such a large platform. Designing buses and 
                            experiences has really opened up my perspective on 
                            how to design large spaces. 
                        </p> 

                        <p>This design was for a Vector event. It was to showcase 
                            the bus and all you can do with it to prospective clients. 
                            I wanted to make the bus stand out and look fun while 
                            also strictly keeping to the brand identity.

                        The DEI brand visually embodies diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
                        Equity as fairness: to allow everyone access to what they need 
                        despite differing circumstances. This is displayed by the different 
                        heights of each rectangle with the help of another rectangle to 
                        allow every column to be equal in height. Diversity through the 
                        changing shapes and colors of each piece of the square, and 
                        inclusion through all the pieces coming together to form one single unit.

                        <p> My process of creating this identity started with researching

                            concepts into one icon. Big themes throughout my research were 
                            overlapping shapes, lots of colors, and the concept of puzzle 
                            pieces coming together. After the informational and image 
                            research, I made 100 sketches; below are four of the final 
                            sketches I chose to develop further.

                <p>
                    The DEI brand visually embodies diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
                    Equity as fairness: to allow everyone access to what they need 
                    despite differing circumstances. This is displayed by the different 
                    heights of each rectangle with the help of another rectangle to 
                    allow every column to be equal in height. Diversity through the 
                    changing shapes and colors of each piece of the square, and 
                    inclusion through all the pieces coming together to form one single unit.

                    There are two variations of the brand system; the main brand that aligns 
                    with the Vector Social Good logo, and a second variation that can be used 
                    independently but also has a strong relationship with the main brand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My process of creating this identity started with researching 
                    other DEI businesses and how to properly incorporate all three 
                    concepts into one icon. Big themes throughout my research were 
                    overlapping shapes, lots of colors, and the concept of puzzle 
                    pieces coming together. After the informational and image 
                    research, I made 100 sketches; below are four of the final 
                    sketches I chose to develop further.

                    <p> The chosen direction above was the most effective direction when 
                    it came to all three concepts. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
                    are all shown in their individual ways while coming together to 
                    form one identity.
