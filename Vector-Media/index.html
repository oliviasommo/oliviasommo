                    <p>This pamphlet was created for the Conservancy to showcase the variety of trees currently found throughout the park.

                    <p>This project was especially enjoyable, as it allowed me to work with beautiful tree photography and bring those visuals to the forefront. I took a minimalist approach to the layout to ensure the images stood out and could speak for themselves.
