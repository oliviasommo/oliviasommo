					    <p> The Last One is about unreproduceability. This project embodies 
                            and demonstrates the principles of the scarcity heuristic 
                            through the lens of endings. You cannot reproduce something 
                            if it is the end of it. There is beauty to endings and the last 
                            time you do something. Sometimes you don’t even know when it 
                            will be the last time. To address this, I decided to letterpress 
                            “last” idiom books. Each book in this series represents “lasts” 
                            through different visual and written interpretations —haikus, single words, and illustrations.  
					    </p>

                        <p>I also chose to letterpress these books. In a way, it is ironic to 
                            letterpress a book about endings when the letterpress was made to 
                            sustain writing and revolutionize the process of printing, but in 
                            today’s day and age, with developing technology, letterpress is rare, 
                            and it is a part of the scarcity heuristic. This project was my 
                            first time using a letterpress machine, but hopefully, it isn’t my last time.

                        <p>One of the challenges of this project was making sure there were enough letters 
                            and different typefaces for all the words I was using. It was a fitting 
                            constraint to have with this project, and I learned how to get creative with minimal tools.  
                        </p> 

                        <p>The paper I chose was also an important choice. It is corn paper, and you can see the 
                            pieces of corn in it. This contributed to the individualism of each book and how none 
                            of the books could ever be reproduced exactly. When printing, I also created a gradient 
                            with the ink to reinforce this concept.
                        </p>

                            I began this project by exploring famous last words. As I compiled a small 
                            collection of last words, it began to turn into a dialogue that I thought 
                            could be fun to explore. The Last Supper ultimately inspired me 
                            to look into last idioms like last meal, last minute, last resort, etc.
                        </p>

                        <p> As I researched, I was also exploring visual ways to convey endings. 
                            I drew images of last idioms, like last minute and last penny. 
                            This was compelling because it made the reader think and try to 
                            figure out what word I was associating with, “Last.”

                        <p> After finalizing the three books, I wanted to letterpress them. 
                            It is a very long and tedious process that almost no one would 
                            want to reproduce. This was a fantastic learning experience 
                            because it allowed me to learn about the history of typography 
                            and graphic design. It also gave me a stronger appreciation for 
                            type and the work behind the digital type we have today.

                        <p>Above is one of the many bus designs I created. 
                            This was a fun wrap, including the inside wrap. This 
                            was my first opportunity to be able to wrap the inside 
                            of the bus along with the outside. It has been amazing 
                            work with such a large platform. Designing buses and 
                            experiences has really opened up my perspective on 
                            how to design large spaces. 
                        </p> 

                        <p>This design was for a Vector event. It was to showcase 
                            the bus and all you can do with it to prospective clients. 
                            I wanted to make the bus stand out and look fun while 
                            also strictly keeping to the brand identity.

                <p>
                    The DEI brand visually embodies diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
                    Equity as fairness: to allow everyone access to what they need 
                    despite differing circumstances. This is displayed by the different 
                    heights of each rectangle with the help of another rectangle to 
                    allow every column to be equal in height. Diversity through the 
                    changing shapes and colors of each piece of the square, and 
                    inclusion through all the pieces coming together to form one single unit.

                    There are two variations of the brand system; the main brand that aligns 
                    with the Vector Social Good logo, and a second variation that can be used 
                    independently but also has a strong relationship with the main brand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My process of creating this identity started with researching 
                    other DEI businesses and how to properly incorporate all three 
                    concepts into one icon. Big themes throughout my research were 
                    overlapping shapes, lots of colors, and the concept of puzzle 
                    pieces coming together. After the informational and image 
                    research, I made 100 sketches; below are four of the final 
                    sketches I chose to develop further.
