					<p> The Human Epoch: Living in the
						Anthropocene was an exhibition I worked
						on during Covid. This exhibition was
						designed for an introductory environmental
						literacy, and science course offered at
						UConn. The work is oriented around the
						concept that human beings are now the
						dominant geological agent. In the 1950s,
						the “Great Acceleration” occurred with
						improving science, technology, energy use,
						the human population, urbanization, and
						species extinctions. This time is debated
						as the beginning of the Anthropocene
						era because of its significant changes in
						geological strata and climate change.
					</p>

					<p> I was given four pieces from the exhibition
						and the Windsor typeface to use in the
						promotional graphics. It was a privilege
						to work on this piece because of its
						importance in history and its influence
						in today’s society on climate change. My
						thought process was to use works to make
						them look like they were going through
						time and changing, similar to the concept
						of The Human Epoch. I did a few iterations
						of the banner in the next series of photos,
						and then it was critiqued and finalized.
