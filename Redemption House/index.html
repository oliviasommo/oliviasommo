					    <p>This is a freelance project Joe Mirrrione commissioned for 
                            me at New Beginning Recovery in New Haven, Connecticut. 
                            New Beginning Recovery is a sober residential living 
                            recovery program for addicts. I was asked to create a new 
                            identity for a program within New Beginning Recovery 
                            called Redemption House. This program is a non-profit 
                            organization that provides short-term housing for addicts 
                            who have relapsed and need a safe place to say so they 
                            can make it back to a recovery house. 
					    </p>

					    <p> I was pleased to help out with this program, and this was 
                            a very fulfilling project for me because my goal as a 
                            designer is to give back to the community positively, and 
                            hearing the recovery stories about what these people have 
                            gone through was compelling. 
					    </p>

                        <p> This project taught me how to use an already-existing 
                            identity to create a cohesive and independent identity 
                            for a program within a larger company. I was able to stick 
                            to the brand colors and typeface while also pushing the 
                            boundaries of the brand with new shapes and concepts to 
                            create an independent identity.

                            The Redemption House identity encompasses all the core values 
                            of what makes Redemption House. Support is shown through the 
                            imagery of a house; growth is embodied through the three triangles 
                            that can be seen as arrows pointing upwardsâ€”collaboration though 
                            the three triangles together; lastly, the triangles are a nod to 
                            the recovery symbol, which is a triangle with a circle around it.

                            client wanted and about the topic of recovery, I created 
                            100 sketches of the new brand identity, then chose four
