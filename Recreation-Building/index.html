					<p> This project was for the opening ceremony of the new recreation building at UConn. This was the first project I worked on for the UConn Recreation Center. I was assigned to create a graphic of the new rec center building.
						The image to the right is what I was told to
						use. I was very nervous about this project
						because it was an ample opportunity, and I
						had never worked with these people before.
						In the following few pages, I go through
						the different iterations I created and how
						I maneuvered this challenge. Below is an
						image of the opening ceremony day where everyone is wearing my shirt. It was surreal to see everyone wearing my work for the first time.
