					    <p> The Wettemann Farm rebrand was a freelance project I was 
                            commissioned to work on by John Wettemann and Marietta DeJulio, 
                            current employees of the farm. The Wettemann Farm has been 
                            in Guilford, Connecticut, since 1907, and working with a 
                            farm on a rebranding project that is so involved with the 
                            community was an amazing opportunity and a huge privilege. The 
                            farm had been around for generations, and everyone in Guilford 
                            knows about it and their impact on the community, so I really 
                            wanted to put my best foot forward with this project to stay 
                            involved with the local community and continue to help the 
                            farm positively impact Guilford, Connecticut.  
                        </p>

					    <p> This project taught me much about a brandâ€™s versatility 
                            while staying cohesive. The farm hosts so many events 
                            and sells a large range of products, so they wanted 
                            something that could be used in many different circumstances.

                            The Wettemann Farm brand is all about inclusivity and farm life. 
                            The typeface I used was Colus Regular. This typeface was a good 
                            choice for the Wettemann farm because of the classic bold letter 
                            and serifs that you see commonly used with farms and outdoor 
                            brands. The farm also wanted imagery in the brand, so I drew simple 
                            designs related to the farm. The image of the barn and the shed 
                            are the exact buildings they have on the farm, so when the 
                            audience sees the logo, it is easily recognizable. I also wanted 
                            to choose images of some products the farm sells, so I drew up 
                            corn and hay for different marketing materials under the brand.
                        </p>

                    <div class= "Information">

                        <p> I started to create this identity by researching other farm and 
                            outdoor brands that used imagery. The key components that the 
                            farm wanted to include in the brand were imagery and versatility. 
                            I made 100 sketches; below are four of the final sketches I chose 
                            to develop further. These three went through the first round of 
                            iterations then the one on the left was chosen to develop further
