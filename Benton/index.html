					    <p> Working as a graphic designer for the William Benton 
                            Museum of Art was a huge privilege, and I am grateful 
                            for the opportunity. I learned how much I enjoy working
                             with museums and art to create positive visitor 
                             experiences. This was also an amazing opportunity to

					    <p> As a graphic designer for The Benton, I created exhibition 
                            identities, wall labels, promotional graphics, and an online 
                            website exhibition for the museum. Working for The Benton 
                            taught me a lot about exhibition and web design. My favorite 
                            part about the job was being able to learn about different 
                            artists and their artwork. I would always start by doing 
                            informational and visual research about the artist and their 
                            work for each exhibition identity I created. Once I felt 
                            like I knew enough about the artist, I would continue my 
                            research on different typefaces that I thought blended well 
                            with each artist and their work. Two examples of exhibition 
                            identities I created are shown to the right and below.

						<h1> Kathe Kollwitz </h1>

					</div>

                    <div class= "Information-right">

                        <p>Kathe Kollwitz was a German artist that specialized in 
                            painting, printmaking, and sculpture. This exhibition 
                            showcased over 100 of her prints and drawings from 
                            The Benton’s collection. 
                        </p> 

                        <p>Kathe’s artwork was focused on the civil injustice 
                            happening in her life. She lived through three political 
                            regimes, the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, and 
                            the Third Reich. She lost her son Peter to World War I 
                            and her grandson to World War II. Many of her wood 
                            carvings focus on her anti-war message after WWI. She 
                            hoped her art would prevent war in the future through 
                            the emotional sacrifices and suffering depicted in her work. 

                        </p> 

                        <p>The typeface I chose to use for this identity was Optima. 
                            German designer Hermann Zapf designed this typeface. Italian 
                            Gravestones inspired Zapf to create Optima. He also lived 
                            through the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich and fought in 
                            WWII. I thought this was a fitting typeface to use with Kathe 
                            Kollwitz because of the parallels between the artists and 
                            what they went through.  Along with the fact that optima was 
                            inspired by gravestones, and it is used on many gravestones 
                            today, like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  
                        </p>

                        <p> The colors I wanted to keep consistent with her wood carvings 
                            to keep cohesion between the art and the type. The very 
                            restraining medium of wood also inspired the rectangles and 
                            lines around the type. She found that wood carvings were most 
                            effective in communicating the suffering she wanted the audience 
                            to feel. All the lines in her prints are very rigid, and I 
                            wanted to keep to that structure.   
                        </p>

                            The Human Epoch: Living in the Anthropocene was an online 
                            exhibition I created. This exhibition was
						designed for an introductory environmental
						literacy, and science course offered at
						UConn. The work is oriented around the
						concept that human beings are now the
						dominant geological agent. In the 1950s,
						the “Great Acceleration” occurred with
						improving science, technology, energy use,
						the human population, urbanization, and
						species extinctions. This time is debated
						as the beginning of the Anthropocene
						era because of its significant changes in
						geological strata and climate change.

                        <p> Based on the “Great Acceleration” that the human race was 
                            going through, I oriented the art pieces with a timeline 
                            so the reader could clearly tell the sequence of events. 
                            I also broke down the paintings into their respective eras 
                            throughout this time period so the information is easier to digest.

                        painting, printmaking, and sculpture. This exhibition 
                        showcased over 100 of her prints and drawings from 
                        The Benton’s collection. 
                    </p> 

                    <p>Kathe’s artwork was focused on the civil injustice 
                        happening in her life. She lived through three political 
                        regimes, the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, and 
                        the Third Reich. She lost her son Peter to World War I 
                        and her grandson to World War II. Many of her wood 
                        carvings focus on her anti-war message after WWI. She 
                        hoped her art would prevent war in the future through 
                        the emotional sacrifices and suffering depicted in her work. 

                    </p> 

                    <p>The typeface I chose to use for this identity was Optima. 
                        German designer Hermann Zapf designed this typeface. Italian 
                        Gravestones inspired Zapf to create Optima. He also lived 
                        through the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich and fought in 
                        WWII. I thought this was a fitting typeface to use with Kathe 
                        Kollwitz because of the parallels between the artists and 
                        what they went through.  Along with the fact that optima was 
                        inspired by gravestones, and it is used on many gravestones 
                        today, like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  
                    </p> 

                    <p> The colors I wanted to keep consistent with her wood carvings 
                        to keep cohesion between the art and the type. The very 
                        restraining medium of wood also inspired the rectangles and 
                        lines around the type. She found that wood carvings were most 
                        effective in communicating the suffering she wanted the audience 
                        to feel. All the lines in her prints are very rigid, and I 
                        wanted to keep to that structure.

                <p>
                    The Human Epoch: Living in the Anthropocene was an online 
                    exhibition I created. This exhibition was
                designed for an introductory environmental
                literacy, and science course offered at
                UConn. The work is oriented around the
                concept that human beings are now the
                dominant geological agent. In the 1950s,
                the “Great Acceleration” occurred with
                improving science, technology, energy use,
                the human population, urbanization, and
                species extinctions. This time is debated
                as the beginning of the Anthropocene
                era because of its significant changes in
                geological strata and climate change.
                </p>

                <p> Based on the “Great Acceleration” that the human race was 
                    going through, I oriented the art pieces with a timeline 
                    so the reader could clearly tell the sequence of events. 
                    I also broke down the paintings into their respective eras 
                    throughout this time period so the information is easier to digest.
