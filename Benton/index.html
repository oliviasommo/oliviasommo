                    <h2>The Human Epoch: Living in the Anthropocene</h2>
                        <p>This magazine utilizes the food expiration date to parallel the expiration of human experiences. Objects that represent stages of life are placed in food containers to convey the sobering but beautiful balance of how we experience endings in life. Sometimes, we remember when things will expire; other times, we forget about them. Either way, we experience the ending and beginning.</p>
                        <p>The expiration date on your Barbie dolls or Hot Wheels doesn’t devalue your experiences with them. You can always go back and play with them, but it will never be with the same excitement you had as a kid. That is okay. It is a part of growing and becoming the best version of yourself. It is beautiful to grow out of your old toys and it is reassuring to know that you appreciated them.</p>
                        <p>Working on this project and reflecting on my life has been a fulfilling experience. I hope you get as much out of it as I did. Think about everything you can learn through the stages of life and appreciate where you are today.</p>

                    <h2>Kathe Kollwitz</h2>
                    <p>I had the amazing opportunity to launch my magazine at the George Billis Gallery in Chelsea — a milestone that marked both a personal and professional achievement. This project contains work that reflects a wide range of emotions and experiences. Sharing it publicly was a vulnerable step, but ultimately a rewarding one.</p>
                    <p>As the sole creator and publisher, I had full creative control throughout the process. This autonomy allowed me to realize a vision that was entirely my own, while also navigating the complex logistics of independent publishing. From concept development to execution, the experience challenged and empowered me.</p>
                    <p>Bringing this project to life required immense effort and commitment, but standing in the gallery, surrounded by my work and those who came to support me was very fulfilling. It was an invaluable opportunity to grow as both an artist and a publisher.</p>
