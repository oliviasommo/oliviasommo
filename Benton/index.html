                    <h2>The Human Epoch: Living in the Anthropocene</h2>
                        <p>The Human Epoch: Living in the Anthropocene was an online exhibition for which I designed the promotional graphics and website.</p>
                        <p>The exhibition centered around the concept of the Anthropocene, a proposed epoch that reflects the profound and lasting impact of human activity on the planet. A key focus was the “Great Acceleration” of the 1950s—a period marked by rapid advancements in science, technology, energy consumption, urbanization, population growth, and biodiversity loss. This era is widely debated as the potential starting point of the Anthropocene due to its dramatic effects on Earth’s systems and geological record.</p>
                        <p>In designing the website layout, I drew inspiration from this rapid progression. I organized the artworks chronologically to reflect the timeline of human impact, allowing viewers to easily follow the sequence of events. The pieces were also grouped by thematic era to enhance clarity and accessibility of the information presented.</p>
                        <p>The gradient graphic—composed of overlapping artworks—was created to serve as a visual timeline that complements the exhibition’s narrative and reinforces the overarching theme of the Anthropocene.</p>

                    <h2>Immigrant Eyes</h2>
                    <p>Immigrant Eyes was an exhibition by photographer Joe Standart, who aims to “highlight the inner dignity each individual possesses, transcending politics and shifting the conversation about immigrant, dreamer, refugee, and citizen identities” (PortraitofAmerica.org).</p>
                    <p>In designing the promotional graphics, I focused on capturing and emphasizing the emotional depth conveyed through the subjects’ eyes. These portraits are incredibly powerful, and it was important to me that the design supported, rather than distracted from, their message and beauty.</p>
                    <p>For this project, I created a full suite of promotional materials, including a web banner and social media posts for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Additionally, I designed an outdoor banner, contributed to gallery labels, and developed a custom map for the outdoor installation that helped visitors locate each photograph within the exhibition space.</p>

                    <h2>Käthe Kollwitz</h2>
                    <p>Käthe Kollwitz was a German artist known for her powerful work in painting, printmaking, and sculpture. Her art centered on themes of civil injustice and human suffering, shaped by the turbulent eras she lived through—the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, and the Third Reich. Kollwitz experienced profound personal loss, including the death of her son Peter in World War I and her grandson in World War II. Through her deeply emotional imagery, she hoped to convey the devastating cost of war and inspire future generations to seek peace.</p>
                    <p>For the visual identity of this project, I selected the typeface Optima, designed by German typographer Hermann Zapf. Inspired by the inscriptions on Italian gravestones, Optima is a humanist sans-serif with classical elegance and solemnity. Zapf, like Kollwitz, lived through the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich, and served in World War II—creating a poignant connection between the designer and the artist. Optima’s use on memorials such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial further reinforced its relevance to the themes of loss and remembrance present in Kollwitz’s work.</p>
                    <p>The color palette was intentionally aligned with the tones found in Kollwitz’s woodcut prints, maintaining visual cohesion between the typography and the artwork. The rigid rectangular elements and lines surrounding the type were inspired by the limitations of the woodcut medium itself. Kollwitz believed woodcuts were the most effective way to communicate the emotional weight of suffering, and I mirrored that structural rigidity in the layout to echo the stark, impactful lines characteristic of her prints.</p>
