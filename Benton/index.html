                    <h2>The Human Epoch: Living in the Anthropocene</h2>
                        <p>This magazine utilizes the food expiration date to parallel the expiration of human experiences. Objects that represent stages of life are placed in food containers to convey the sobering but beautiful balance of how we experience endings in life. Sometimes, we remember when things will expire; other times, we forget about them. Either way, we experience the ending and beginning.</p>
                        <p>The expiration date on your Barbie dolls or Hot Wheels doesn’t devalue your experiences with them. You can always go back and play with them, but it will never be with the same excitement you had as a kid. That is okay. It is a part of growing and becoming the best version of yourself. It is beautiful to grow out of your old toys and it is reassuring to know that you appreciated them.</p>
                        <p>Working on this project and reflecting on my life has been a fulfilling experience. I hope you get as much out of it as I did. Think about everything you can learn through the stages of life and appreciate where you are today.</p>
