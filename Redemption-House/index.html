                    <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
                        <p>This freelance project was commissioned by New Beginning Recovery in New Haven, Connecticut—a sober residential program supporting individuals in recovery from addiction. I was tasked with developing a new visual identity for a program within the organization called Redemption House. This non-profit initiative offers short-term housing for individuals who have relapsed and need a safe, supportive space before transitioning back into a recovery home.</p>
                        <p>This was a fulfilling project for me. As a designer, I aim to create work that contributes positively to the community, and hearing the personal recovery stories behind this initiative made the experience even more meaningful.</p>
                        <p>A key challenge—and learning opportunity—was designing an identity that aligned with the overarching New Beginning Recovery brand while establishing a distinct, independent visual presence for Redemption House. I maintained consistency with the existing brand’s color palette and typeface but introduced new shapes and design elements to give the sub-brand its own voice.</p>
                        <p>The Redemption House identity reflects the program’s core values. The house symbolizes safety and support; the three upward-pointing triangles represent growth and progress; and together, they embody collaboration and unity. These shapes also reference the recovery symbol—a triangle enclosed in a circle—subtly reinforcing the mission of the organization through visual language.</p>
