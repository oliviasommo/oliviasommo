					    <p> Through the Miko McGinty design and publication studio, 
                            I was given the amazing opportunity to work on the graphics
                             and signage for the Madison Square Park Conservancy. 
                             Using the brand identity developed by Pentagram, I 
                             created park signs and worked on exhibition labels, 
                             Kiosks, pamphlets, and more for the Conservancy. I 
                             created the files, then prepared and send them to print. 
                             I learned how to effectively use preexisting design 
                             systems to create new material while keeping to the 
                             identity. This was an amazing learning experience, and 
                             I am grateful to the McGinty design studio.

					    </p>

					    <p> The evergreen kiosk I created for the Park is in the 
                            photo to the right. This is used to tell all the park 
                            visitors all the events that the conservancy is currently 
                            hosting. I worked on the building illustrations and 
                            all the typography that went into this project. This 
                            went through many rounds of iterations and feedback, 
                            and I am very happy with the results.

						<h1> Park Signage </h1>

					</div>

                    <div class= "Information-right">

                        <p>To the left is one of the many park signs I worked on. 
                            I would make a few of these depending on events or 
                            depending on what the conservancy wanted to emphasize. 
                            I learned a lot about interactive design and how visitors 
                            respond to this type of signage. Specifically, using 
                            typography and the brand identityâ€™s hierarchy to create
                            a sign that is most effective, clearly communicates 
                            the message, and is easy to read. 

                        </p> 

                        <p>The process of creating these signs was very beneficial 
                            to learn because, other than designing the signboard, 
                            I also was responsible for working with the company 
                            VSEEN directly to send all the files to print. 

                        </p> 

                        <p>I would start the design with a blank template file from 
                            Pentagram; then, I would place the text into InDesign 
                            and categorize it with the hierarchy to create the signboard. 
                            Once all the text was in place, I went through all the 
                            typography with a strict eye to make sure all the typography 
                            was correct, and the text was the most optimal for the 
                            audience to read. Once this process was complete, I sent 
                            the file for review, and it would go through a few rounds 
                            of iterations. 

                        </p> 

                        <p> So, once this process was complete, I prepared and packaged 
                            the print-ready file to send to the printer. I learned a 
                            lot about all the requirements the printing company needs 
                            to be able to print signboards in a timely manner. From 
                            the material, sizing, and packaged or outlined fonts to 
                            making sure someone would be there to pick up the 
                            signboard and put it out.  

                        </p>

                            Above is one of the pamphlets I worked on; I tried to make this 
                            pamphlet cohesive, professional, and clean for readers to 
                            learn about all trees in the park. This was a fun project to 
                            be able to work with full-bleed photographs, especially in the 
                            center spread. I also wanted to take a minimalist approach to 
                            this pamphlet so photos stood out to the reader. I learned a 
                            lot about publication typography throughout this project.

                <p>Above is one of the pamphlets I worked on; I tried to make this 
                    pamphlet cohesive, professional, and clean for readers to 
                    learn about all trees in the park. This was a fun project to 
                    be able to work with full-bleed photographs, especially in the 
                    center spread. I also wanted to take a minimalist approach to 
                    this pamphlet so photos stood out to the reader. I learned a 
                    lot about publication typography throughout this project.
