                    <h2>Evergreen Kiosk</h2>
                        <p>While working with the design and publication studio Miko McGinty Inc., I had the opportunity to contribute to the visual communications for the Madison Square Park Conservancy. Building on the brand identity developed by Pentagram, I created park signage, exhibition labels, kiosks, pamphlets, and additional collateral materials for the Conservancy.</p>
                        <p>My responsibilities included designing layouts, preparing final production files, and coordinating with print vendors. This experience strengthened my ability to work within an established design system while creating fresh, cohesive materials that align with a well-defined brand identity. It was a valuable and rewarding learning experience, and I’m especially grateful to the team at Miko McGinty Inc.</p>
                        <p>The images shown here highlight the Evergreen Kiosk, a key signage element used by the Conservancy to communicate current events and offerings to park visitors. For this project, I was responsible for the building illustrations and all typographic design. The work went through several rounds of iteration and feedback, and I’m proud of the final outcome.</p>

                    <h2>Tree Newsletter</h2>
                    <p>This pamphlet was created for the Conservancy to showcase the variety of trees currently found throughout the park. My goal was to design a cohesive, professional, and accessible piece that would help visitors learn more about their local environment and the trees they pass by every day.</p>
                    <p>This project was especially enjoyable, as it allowed me to work with beautiful tree photography and bring those visuals to the forefront. I took a minimalist approach to the layout to ensure the images stood out and could speak for themselves. Throughout the design process, I placed a strong emphasis on publication typography, working to strike a balance between clarity and visual interest while staying consistent with the Conservancy’s established brand identity.</p>
