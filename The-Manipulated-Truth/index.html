                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>The concept of the truth has always been concrete to me. Although recently, it seems the truth is being manipulated through technology and greed for financial gain. Lies spread six times as fast as the truth. The dark reality we live today is: Will we be able to emerge from the spread of misinformation and allow factual information to prevail? Or will we deteriorate from the spread of unreliable, sometimes even dangerous, socially destabilizing ideas? (Anderson, Jenna). This project blurs the line of the truth between true statements that seem false, false statements that seem true, and opinions disguised as facts. This was a very open-ended prompt I chose to explore because the truth can also differ greatly from different perspectives. The manipulated truth project aims to bring awareness to this heavy issue by starting a discussion about what you believe to be true. Through newspapers, postcards, a book, and the Truth Machine, people will be more aware of this issue and hopefully work to restore trust in the truth.</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>I had the amazing opportunity to launch my magazine at the George Billis Gallery in Chelsea — a milestone that marked both a personal and professional achievement. This project contains work that reflects a wide range of emotions and experiences. Sharing it publicly was a vulnerable step, but ultimately a rewarding one.</p>
                    <p>As the sole creator and publisher, I had full creative control throughout the process. This autonomy allowed me to realize a vision that was entirely my own, while also navigating the complex logistics of independent publishing. From concept development to execution, the experience challenged and empowered me.</p>
                    <p>Bringing this project to life required immense effort and commitment, but standing in the gallery, surrounded by my work and those who came to support me was very fulfilling. It was an invaluable opportunity to grow as both an artist and a publisher.</p>
