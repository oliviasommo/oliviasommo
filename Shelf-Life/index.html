					    <p> The concept of the truth has always been concrete to me. Although recently, 
                            it seems the truth is being manipulated through technology and greed for 
                            financial gain. Lies spread six times as fast as the truth. The dark reality 
                            we live today is: Will we be able to emerge from the spread of misinformation 
                            and allow factual information to prevail? Or will we deteriorate from the 
                            spread of unreliable, sometimes even dangerous, socially destabilizing ideas? (Anderson, Jenna).

                        <p>This project blurs the line of the truth between true statements that seem false,

                            open-ended prompt I chose to explore because the truth can also differ greatly

                        <p>One of the challenges of this project was making sure there were enough letters 
                            and different typefaces for all the words I was using. It was a fitting 
                            constraint to have with this project, and I learned how to get creative with minimal tools.  
                        </p> 

                        <p>The paper I chose was also an important choice. It is corn paper, and you can see the 
                            pieces of corn in it. This contributed to the individualism of each book and how none 
                            of the books could ever be reproduced exactly. When printing, I also created a gradient 
                            with the ink to reinforce this concept.

                            I started this project with visual and informational research. Someone 
                            who I was heavily influenced by was the designer Michael Rock. He talks 
                            about how critical perspective is and how you reveal your views when 
                            designing. This concept relates to the manipulated truth because perspective 
                            also has a significant role in what people believe is true or false. 
                            All of my iterations of this concept stem from perspective. An important 
                            quote that I learned when studying this project was, “Information is only 
                            as reliable as the people reading it.”(Julia Koller).

                            project because I used it to inform the audience which information is true 
                            false, or an opinion. Blue represents true information, yellow is false
