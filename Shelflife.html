                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>This project came at a time when I was in my mid-20s experiencing many endings. The first big step was moving out of my childhood home. Once I did that, it really hit me. If things work out, I will never live with my mom and sister again. September 3, 2022, was my last night as a full-time resident at my mom’s house, where I lived for 23 years.</p>
                        <p>This was the catalyst. Soon, I started to notice how easily people go through life experiencing “endings” and “lasts” without knowing it. I noticed everything. I thought back and remembered the difficult endings, the ones I was happy about, and the  ones I didn’t know were endings. I started to consider my experiences when I was seeing old friends or family or when I was doing mundane tasks that I loved.</p>
                        <p>Will this be the last time?</p>
                        <p>I wanted to work with food and expiration dates because they are so tangible to human experience. Everyone has forgotten about expired foods in the back of their refrigerator or pantry.</p>
                        <p>This magazine utilizes the food expiration date to parallel the expiration of human experiences. Objects that represent stages of life are placed in food containers to convey the sobering but beautiful balance of how we experience endings in life. Sometimes, we remember when things will expire; other times, we forget about them. Either way, we experience the ending and beginning.</p>
                        <p>The expiration date on your Barbie dolls or Hot Wheels doesn’t devalue your experiences with them. You can always go back and play with them, but it will never be with the same excitement you had as a kid. That is okay. It is a part of growing and becoming the best version of yourself. It is beautiful to grow out of your old toys and it is reassuring to know that you appreciated them.</p>
                        <p>Working on this project and reflecting on my life has been a fulfilling experience. I hope you get as much out of it as I did. Think about everything you can learn through the stages of life and appreciate where you are today.</p>
